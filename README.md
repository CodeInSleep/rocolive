**Interface**

RoCo is a set of libraries that help in the design and construction of robots. Advanced users can build robots directly through Python scripts that import the RoCo module but we also provide a web interface that presents an intuitive method to build robots for those unfamiliar with Python.

To install the RoCo Interface, git clone this repository.
To start the server locally, cd into the interface_roco folder. Now, execute
```
python manaage.py runserver
```
on the command line.
On your browser, visit localhost:8000 to open the interface.
